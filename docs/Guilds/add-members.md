To add members they will first need to be whitelisted with an assigned role.

Currently, guilds have 3 types of roles defined where accounts can only be whitelisted to 1 role:

- Admin - Access to add and remove members. Can also deposit, withdraw and execute calls from the guild.

- Owner - Access to deposit and withdraw from guild. Can also execute calls from guild.

- Member - Access is only to execute calls from the guild.

---

To whitelist members add their wallet address into the account field, click on the role to change the role then select 'Add Member'. 

:::note NOTE
You can whitelist multiple addresses at the same time. 

:::

Once you've added members, click 'Whitelist Members' and approve the transaction through the wallet pop-up and the transaction will appear in the notifications.
