# Introduction

## Guildly

We are working with Guildly to enable the use of special types of accounts ("guilds") within the Realmverse. These accounts provide multiplayer functionality, allowing pools of items to be shared for certain tasks and shared game progression states.

## What does this mean?

Implementing these smart accounts provides a range of benefits for us and our players.
