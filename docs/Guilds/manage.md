# Manage Guild

The guild can establish certain roles allowing dynamic guild structure to efficiently manage. 
Through the permissions you will be able to set what happens within your guild and how items can be used by the guild owners. 

You will automatically be assigned Admin role. You can add members, owners and admins to the guild. Whitelist the addresses and choose their roles.
