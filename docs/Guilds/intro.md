# Guilds

Guilds allow cooperative game play where items can be shared and used within your guilds all in the Realmverse. Build economies, share resources and aid each other.

## Guildly

We are working with [Guildly](https://alpha.guildly.xyz/) to enable the use of special types of accounts ("guilds"). These accounts provide multiplayer functionality, allowing pools of items to be shared for certain tasks and **shared game progression** states.

:::note NOTE

You will need an L2 StarkNet wallet to connect to [Guildly](https://alpha.guildly.xyz/) and to play Realms.
